## Project Overview

The Distributor module allows users to:
- Manage distributors, add or confirm orders.
- Calculate shipping costs based on the origin and destination cities as well as the package weight.
- Track shipments by entering a tracking number (resi).
- Update and manage shipping statuses via an admin interface.

## Features

- **Login System**: Authenticate users before granting access to the admin interface.
- **Order Management**: Admins can add, edit, confirm, and delete distributor orders.
- **Shipping Cost Calculation**: Automatically calculates shipping costs based on the selected origin, destination cities, and weight.
- **Real-time Database**: Integrates with **Firebase Firestore** to store and retrieve distributor orders and shipping data.
- **Order Tracking**: Users can check the status of their orders using a tracking number (resi).
- **Shipping Status Update**: Admins can update the shipping status and move completed orders to history.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend development.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **Firebase**: Firestore is used to store and manage distributor data.
- **HTML/CSS**: To structure and style the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity for functionalities like password visibility toggling and form handling.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afifilhamh/iak_distributor5.git
cd distributor-module
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Firebase

- Create a Firebase project and set up Firestore.
- Download the service account key from Firebase and save it in the root directory with the filename `ladju_distributor.json`.
  
### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, hereâ€™s how you can use it:

### User Features

1. **Login**: Users must log in through `/login`. Credentials are validated using data stored in Firebase.
2. **Order Tracking**: Visitors can check the status of their orders using their tracking number (resi) by entering it on the homepage.

### Admin Features

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Once logged in, users can access the admin interface where they can:
   - View all distributor orders.
   - Confirm orders by calculating shipping costs based on distance and weight.
   - Update order statuses (e.g., "Kurir mengambil paket", "Pesanan Selesai").
   - Delete completed orders from the history.
   
2. **Shipping Cost Calculation**: The system calculates shipping costs based on predefined distances between cities (`JARAK_KOTA`) and the package weight. Admins can then confirm the cost and finalize the shipment.

### Routes

- `/login`: User login page.
- `/logout`: Logs out the current session.
- `/admin`: Admin dashboard for managing orders.
- `/api/distributor5/orders/cek_ongkir`: API route for checking shipping costs.
- `/api/distributor5/orders/fix_kirim`: API route for confirming an order.
- `/update_status`: Update the status of a shipment.
- `/`: Home page, allows users to check order status by entering a tracking number.
